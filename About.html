                    We are a very friendly Jiu Jitzu club with links to the university, everyone is welcome student or not! We practice Seishin Mizu Ryu Jiu Jitsu (Water Mind School of Fighting Arts). We train hard but enjoy ourselves at the same time. There are also many socials throughout the year to go outand have fun with the club. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Seishin Mizu Ryu Tatakai Jutsu is a holistic martial art whose core techniques can be traced back to the battlefields of feudal Japan.
                    The style is a form through which the significant underlying martial principles found in the ancient martial traditions of Tai Chi Chuan (Chinese origin) and Ju Jutsu (Japanese origin) are brought together, re-examined, re-evaluated and developed. These arts were found to be pivotal in the development of martial arts and are known collectively as the father and mother arts respectively.
                    The style has an extensive unarmed syllabus which has a proven track record as an effective self-defence. Traditional weapons are also main arms of the style, with students developing proficiency in the staff and sword arts as they progress towards black belt. Ground fighting and pressure points are also taught.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All classes are taught in a traditional friendly manner by an experienced black belt. Here you can learn at your own pace, acquiring self-confidence along the way.
                    The underlying principle of the school is to have continuous flow thus the techniques amassed can be used in ways which use an aggressors strength against themselves and therefore gender, age and fitness are negated in favour of good technique.
